# Sudoku
I’m sure you have played the famous Sudoku game before – at least you must have heard it. Sudoku /suːˈdoʊkuː/ is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "sub-squares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which typically has a unique solution. (From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).
This project provides an online 2 player Sudoku game. There is a host player, who starts a game and waits for a guest player to join; and a guest player that joins an on-going game started by the host player. Notice that the host player can play by himself if there is no one joining the game.
